  <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

  <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor — try this homemade lasagna recipe today!</p>
